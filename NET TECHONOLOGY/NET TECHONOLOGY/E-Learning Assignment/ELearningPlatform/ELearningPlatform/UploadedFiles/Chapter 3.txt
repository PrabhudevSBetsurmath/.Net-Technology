Small
-->The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that
they should be smaller than that.

Blocks and Indenting
-->statement under if else while should not be more than one line and that line should be a fuction call so that you can read properly.

Do One Thing
-->FUNCTIONS SHOULD DO ONE THING. THEY SHOULD DO IT WELL. THEY SHOULD DO IT ONLY.

One Level of Abstraction per Function
-->once details are mixed with essential concepts, more and more details tend to accrete within the function.

Reading Code from Top to Bottom: The Stepdown Rule
--> code should feel like naration top to bottom. single levbel of abstraction.

switch statement
-->switch statement does N things and cant be minimized so we should use polimorphism.	hide switch statement inside a abstract factory/hide behind inheritane.

Use descriptive names
--> give peoper names to the function, names can be long. use naming convention. Be consistant in your names.use proper noun verbs etc.

Function arguments
-->use less number of paramters so that user can understand what to pass in the funtion.

common monadic form
-->

verbs and keywords
--> good names to be given.

error handling is one thing
-->error handling function should do only 1 things and shoulf not interfear in other function.

Do not repeat yourself
--> avoid duplication of code.
